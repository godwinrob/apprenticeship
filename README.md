## :bulb: Why We Do Apprenticeships
Experienced developers are in high demand; in contrast, few companies have the means or inclination to hire candidates new to tech and development. We see early career developers as untapped resources that can thrive in the type of environment we foster on our team. We love paired programming and do it daily. We detest gatekeeping and believe it's important to share knowledge across the team and P&G at large. Lastly, we strive for diversity in our team's makeup, and we see the apprenticeship as a means to create opportunities for people from a multitude of backgrounds and skillsets. It's also an opportunity to strengthen our internal engineering presence at P&G.

## :eyeglasses: Who We're Looking For
We're looking for early-career developers seeking hands-on experience working in cloud technology. Candidates should be comfortable working independently and in groups to solve challenging engineering problems. Good communication skills will be essential to keep your team and mentor informed about how you are progressing with the curriculum and what support you need along the way. We don't expect candidates to have deep expertise or prior exposure to any technologies we use. We do expect candidates to be kind, curious, and gritty, as these are the characteristics of our team that drive us to deliver world-class technological solutions.

## :white_check_mark: Hiring process
Our initial interviews will take place in the last week of July 2022. Candidates moving forward will be invited to a technical interview where they will walk through a coding project with members of the Lightyear team. Other P&G hiring processes may include: a behavioral assessment, a logic assessment, and one or more PEAK interviews with people outside the Lightyear team.
